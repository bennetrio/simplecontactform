Tested up to: 4.9.8

An extremely simple plugin for contact form with email facility.

== Description ==
This lightweight plugin allows creating a simple contact form. The reason this plugin stands out is that it doesn\'t create any additional tables in the database. It simply sends an email to the admin and also creates a comment on the page which if turned off can be only viewed by the admin. This gives complete control of the form.

The form can be implemented on any page or post by simply adding the shortcode [simplecontactform]
